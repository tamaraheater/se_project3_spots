**Intro**

This project is a social media project with designs coming from a design figma, made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This project features a profile area where the "Name" and "Description" are able to expand to 3 line all while limiting line expansion in the beautiful image shariung section. It also features a link hover changing opacities with pointer objects to allow users to know the area is clickable and with the ability to edit the information.

This project uses and demonstrates the results of HTML and CSS technology and international acessability standards.

All code has been verified as per the standard of W3Schools and utilizes the internationally accepted methodology of BEM, a technique developed by the founder(s) of the TrippleTen Software Engineering Program.

The design figma can be seen below.
